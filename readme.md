# Convert Markdown Files to HTML.

This is my first real project in Rust.  It is a command-line tool for converting markdown files to HTML to aid in the proccess of creating web pages.


## Usage Instructions
__*TBD*__


## Why?
Because HTML is a bullshit and tedious language to write from scratch so I prefer markdown, but don't want to have to deal with implementing markdown support on my server.  

This allows me to generate content faster by using markdown to sketch out my pages and then compile them into an agnostic format for ease of use by me.
